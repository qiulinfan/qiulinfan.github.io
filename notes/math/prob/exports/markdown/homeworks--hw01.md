## Problem 1 {#problem-1-1}

Let $n \in {\mathbb{N}}$.

- Show that $2^{n} = \sum_{k = 0}^{n}\left( \frac{n}{k} \right)$. Given that a set of $n$ elements has $2^{n}$ subsets, what is the combinatorial interpretation of this equality?

- Show that

  $$
  \sum\limits_{k\ \text{odd},0 \leq k \leq n}\left( \frac{n}{k} \right) = \sum\limits_{k\ \text{even},0 \leq k \leq n}\left( \frac{n}{k} \right)
  $$

- Show that

  $$
  \left( \frac{2n}{n} \right) = \sum\limits_{k = 0}^{n}\left( \frac{n}{k} \right)^{2}
  $$

Hint: You may use $\left( \frac{n}{k} \right)^{2} = \left( \frac{n}{k} \right)\left( \frac{n}{n - k} \right)$.

## Problem 2 {#problem-2-1}

We roll a fair die three times and record the outcomes $a,b,c \in \left\{ {1,2,3,4,5,6} \right\}$. What is the probability that the equation $ax^{2} + bx + c = 0$ does not have solutions in the real numbers?

> **Solution**
>
> The equation $ax^{2} + bx + c = 0$ does not have solutions in the real numbers iff the the discriminant is negative, i.e. $\Delta = b^{2} - 4ac < 0$.\
> Total possible equations is $6^{3} = 216$. For each $b$, the total possible $(a,c)$ pairs are $36$. We can calculate the number of $(a,c)$ pairs that satisfy the condition case by case.
>
> - For $b = 1$: $4ac > 1$ holds for all $(a,c)$.
>
> - For $b = 2$: $4ac > 4\Longrightarrow ac > 1$, which excludes only $(1,1)$.
>
> - For $b = 3$: $4ac > 9\Longrightarrow ac \geq 3$ since they are integers, so excluding $(1,1),(1,2),(2,1)$ ($3$ cases).
>
> - For $b = 4$: $4ac > 16\Longrightarrow ac \geq 5$, excluding: $(1,3),(1,4),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1)$ besides the previous case, thus $8$ cases excluded.
>
> - For $b = 5$: $4ac > 25\Longrightarrow ac \geq 7$, excluding: $(1,5),(1,6),(2,3),(3,2),(5,1),(6,1)$ besides the previous case, thus $14$ cases excluded.
>
> - For $b = 6$: $4ac > 36\Longrightarrow ac \geq 10$, excluding: $(2,4),(3,3),(4,2)$ besides the previous case, thus $17$ cases excluded.

## Problem 3 {#problem-3-1}

An ant starts at the origin $(0,0)$ on the integer lattice. At each step it moves either one unit to the right or one unit upward, each with probability $\frac{1}{2}$. The ant continues moving until it reaches the point $(205,200)$.\
What is the probability that the ant visits the point $(105,100)$ at some time during its journey?\
Hint: Start by counting the number of paths from $(0,0)$ to $(205,200)$.

> **Solution**
>
> Any path from $(0,0)$ to $(205,200)$ must consist of $205$ steps to the right and $200$ steps upward, for a total of $405$ steps. So a path is uniquely determined by the choice of 205 steps to the right (which is equivalent to the choice of 200 steps upward).\
> Thus total number of paths from $(0,0)$ to $(205,200)$ is
>
> $$
> N = \left( \frac{405}{205} \right)
> $$
>
> A path passes through the point $(105,100)$ if and only if it first goes from $(0,0)$ to $(105,100)$ and then from $(105,100)$ to $(205,200)$.\
> Thus the number of such paths is the product of the number of paths from $(0,0)$ to $(105,100)$ and the number of paths from $(105,100)$ to $(205,200)$, by the fundamental counting principle. For the same reason as deciding the number of total paths from $(0,0)$ to $(205,200)$, the number of paths from $(0,0)$ to $(105,100)$ is

> $$
> N_{1} = \left( \frac{205}{105} \right)

>
> And similarly, the number of paths from $(105,100)$ to $(205,200)$ is
>
> $$
> N_{2} = \left( \frac{200}{100} \right)
> $$
>
> Note that from a point to another point, all such paths are equally likely to be chosen. Therefore, the desired probability is
>
> $$
> {\mathbb{P}}(\text{path passes through}(105,100)) = \frac{\left( \frac{205}{105} \right)\left( \frac{200}{100} \right)}{\left( \frac{405}{205} \right)}

## Problem 4 {#problem-4-1}

From a lottery containing $n$ tickets numbered $1,2,\ldots,n$, a ticket is drawn, its number is recorded, and then it is returned to the lottery. This process is repeated $k \geq 3$ times. Find the probabilities of the following events:

- Ticket 1 is selected at least once.

- Tickets 1, 2, and 3 are each selected at least once.

> **Solution**
>
> - Let $E$ be the event that ticket $1$ is selected at least once. \$\$\\begin{align\*} \\mathbb{P}(E) &= 1 - \\mathbb{P}(\\text{ticket \$1\$ is never selected in \$k\$ draws}) \\\\ &= 1 - \\left(\\frac{n-1}{n}\\right)\^k \\tag\*{\\text{(by independence of each draw)}} \\end{align\*}\$\$

## Problem 5 {#problem-5-1}

In a house, drawer $S_{1}$ contains 3 gold coins and 3 silver coins, while drawer $S_{2}$ contains 3 gold coins and 6 silver coins. A thief (in the dark) randomly opens one drawer and then randomly takes two coins from it.

- What is the probability that both coins are gold?

- If it is discovered (upon his arrest) that he has stolen two gold coins, what is the probability that he opened drawer $S_{1}$ ?

> **Solution**
>
> The thief chooses a drawer uniformly at random, so for each pick, ${\mathbb{P}}(S_{1}\ \text{is chosen}) = {\mathbb{P}}(S_{2}\ \text{is chosen}) = \frac{1}{2}$. Given a drawer, he draws two coins without replacement.

## Problem 6 {#problem-6-1}

Let $A$ and $B$ be events of a probability space with ${\mathbb{P}}(A) > 0$. Show that:

- ${\mathbb{P}}(A \cup B) > 0$ and ${\mathbb{P}}(A \cap B \mid A \cup B) \leq {\mathbb{P}}(A \cap B \mid A)$.

- ${\mathbb{P}}(B \mid B \cup A) \geq {\mathbb{P}}(B \mid A)$.

> **Proof**
>
> - Since $A \subseteq A \cup B$, we have by monotonicity of probability measure:
>
>   $$
>   {\mathbb{P}}(A \cup B) \geq {\mathbb{P}}(A) > 0

>
>   Also, since $A \cap B \subseteq A$ and ${\mathbb{P}}(A \cup B) \geq {\mathbb{P}}(A) > 0$, both conditional probabilities below are well-defined. Then

>    & {= {\mathbb{P}}(A \cap B \mid A)}
>   \end{matrix}

>
>   This finishes the proof.
>
> - Let $x := {\mathbb{P}}(A \cap B)$, $y := {\mathbb{P}}(A\backslash B)$, $z := {\mathbb{P}}(B\backslash A)$.\

>   $$
>
>   Thus, we have:
>

>
>   By similar reason, we have:

>   {\mathbb{P}}(A \cup B) = x + y + z,\quad{\mathbb{P}}(B) = x + z

>
>   Thus we have:
>
>   $$
>   {\mathbb{P}}(B \mid A \cup B) = \frac{{\mathbb{P}}(B \cap (A \cup B))}{{\mathbb{P}}(A \cup B)} = \frac{{\mathbb{P}}(B)}{{\mathbb{P}}(A \cup B)} = \frac{x + z}{x + y + z}

>
>   Note the two probabilities are well-defined since $x + y = {\mathbb{P}}(A) > 0$ (and so $x + y + z > 0$).\
