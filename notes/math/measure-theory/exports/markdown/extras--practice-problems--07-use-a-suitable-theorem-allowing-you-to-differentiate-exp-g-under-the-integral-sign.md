# Use a suitable theorem allowing you to differentiate $\exp(g)$ under the integral sign {#use-a-suitable-theorem-allowing-you-to-differentiate-exp-g-under-the-integral-sign}

Let $f$ be a real Lebesgue measurable function on the interval $\lbrack 0,1\rbrack$ such that $\parallel f\underset{\infty}{\parallel} < \infty$. For $\alpha \in {\mathbb{R}}$ define a function $g(\alpha)$ by

$$g(\alpha) = \log\left\lbrack {\int_{0}^{1}\exp\lbrack\alpha f(x)\rbrack dx} \right\rbrack$$



\(a\) Prove that the function $g( \cdot )$ is twice continuously differentiable and that $g^{''}(\alpha) \geq 0$ for all $\alpha \in {\mathbb{R}}$, i.e. the function $g( \cdot )$ is convex. (b) Prove that if $f$ is a non-constant function, i.e. $m\left\{ x \in \lbrack 0,1\rbrack: \middle| f(x) - c \middle| \neq 0 \right\} > 0$ for all constants $c \in {\mathbb{R}}$, then $g^{''}(\alpha) > 0,\alpha \in {\mathbb{R}}$.
