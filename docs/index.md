</div>This is Qiulin, senior undergrad from University of Michigan, dual majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science. 

My career interest mainly lies in Computer Vision, Computer Graphics, Game DeV and Game Engine Development.

I am also a Math fan out of interest. I love analysis and differential geometry. So far I have read *Real Analysis: Modern Techniques and Their Applications* by Folland for measure theory and *Intro to Topological Manifolds* by John Lee for topology, etc. Currently I am reading *Probability: Theory and Examples* by Durret for measure-based probability theory, and *Intro to Smooth Manifolds* by John Lee for differential topology. I plan to finish them in this year and next year I will learn some Fourier analysis, stochastic differential equations and Riemannian geometry. I post notes on my personal website, the majority of which are written in Chinese.



## Game Projects

### Recreation of Zelda 1986, Dungen Level 1

This is my replica of the OG game Zelda 1986, coauthered with James Tian: [Zelda 1986 Game](https://saddysamoyed.itch.io/zelda1986-level1), as the project 1 of EECS 494. The game is hosted on [itch.io](https://itch.io/) and you can play it online, or use the download link on the game page.

The game is produced by Unity and C#. I implemented the enemy AI system, health system, room control system, bomb and boomerang weapons; I also designed our custom feature: shadow, and made most of the animations.

Animations are made out of open-source spritesheets found on [Open Sprite Resource](https://www.spriters-resource.com/). Some art resources like background music in our custom levels are made by Suno AI, and some complex custom sprites are generated by diffusion models.
