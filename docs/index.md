This Qiulin, senior undergrad from University of Michigan, dual majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science.  

My career interest mainly lies in Computer Vision, Computer Graphics, Game DeV and Game Engine Development. 

I am also a MATH fan out fo interest. I love analysis and differential geometry. So far I have read *Real Analysis: Modern Techniques and Their Applications* by Folland for measure theory and *Intro to Topological Manifolds* by John Lee for topology, etc. Currently I am reading *Probability: Theory and Examples* by Durret for measure-based probability theory, and *Intro to Smooth Manifolds* by John Lee for differential topology. I plan to finish them in this year and next year I will learn some Fourier analysis, stochastic differential equations and Riemannian geometry. I post notes on my personal website, the majority of which are written in Chinese.
