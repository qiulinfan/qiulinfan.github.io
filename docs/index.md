</div>This is Qiulin, senior undergrad from University of Michigan, dual majoring in Mathematics (Honors) and Computer Science. 


My career interest mainly lies in Computer Vision, Computer Graphics, Game Development and Game Engine Development. I am familiar with C++ and Unreal Engine; and proficient in python, C# and Unity engine.

I am also a Math fan out of interest. I love analysis and differential geometry. Currently I am reading *Probability: Theory and Examples* by Durret for measure-based probability theory, and *Intro to Smooth Manifolds* by John Lee for differential topology.

I post study notes on Github. Some are made into Github pages that can be found here.



## Game Projects

### Recreation of Zelda 1986, Dungen Level 1

Check this link for my replica of the OG game Zelda 1986, coauthered with James Tian: [Zelda 1986 Game](https://saddysamoyed.itch.io/zelda1986-level1).

  <p style="font-size:0.8em; color:gray; margin:20px 0;">
</div>The game is hosted on itch and you can play it online, or use the download link on the game page.

The game is produced by Unity and C#. I implemented the enemy AI system, health system, room control system, bomb and boomerang weapons; I also designed our custom feature: shadow, and made most of the animations.

Animations are made out of open-source spritesheets found on [Open Sprite Resource](https://www.spriters-resource.com/). Some art resources like background music in our custom levels are made by Suno AI, and some complex custom sprites are generated by diffusion models.
