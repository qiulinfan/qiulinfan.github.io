This Qiulin, senior undergrad from University of Michigan, dual majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science.  

My interest mainly lies in Computer Vision, Computer Graphics, Game DeV and Game Engine Development. 

I also love Math, more of interest more than career. I like Analysis and Differential Geometry. So far I have read *Real Analysis: Modern Techniques and Their Applications* by Folland for measure theory and *Intro to Topological Manifolds* by John Lee for topology, etc. Currently I am reading *Probability: Theory and Examples* by Durret for measure-based probability theory, and *Intro to Smooth Manifolds* by John Lee for differential topology. I plan to finish them in this year and next year I will learn some stochastic differential equations and Riemannian geometry. I post notes on my personal website, the majority of which are written in Chinese.
