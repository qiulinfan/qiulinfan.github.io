# Qiulin 的笔记主页

This Qiulin, senior undergrad from University of Michigan, dual majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science. 

My interest mainly lies in Computer Vision, Computer Graphics, Game DeV and Game Engine Dev.

数学上

For the Math part (more of interest than career) I love to read 

I post notes on my personal website, the majority of which are written in Chinese.
