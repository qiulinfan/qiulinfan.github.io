I love analysis and differential geometry. So far I have read Real Analysis: Modern Techniques and Their Applications by Folland for measure theory and Intro to Topological Manifolds by John Lee for topology, etc. Currently I am reading Probability: Theory and Examples by Durret for measure-based probability theory, and Intro to Smooth Manifolds by John Lee for differential topology. I plan to finish them in this year and next year I will learn some Fourier analysis, stochastic differential equations and Riemannian geometry. I post notes on my personal website, the majority of which are written in Chinese.</p>"},{"location":"#game-projects","title":"Game Projects","text":""},{"location":"#recreation-of-zelda-1986-dungen-level-1","title":"Recreation of Zelda 1986, Dungen Level 1","text":"<p>This is my replica of the OG game Zelda 1986, coauthered with James Tian: Zelda 1986 Game, as the project 1 of EECS 494. The game is hosted on itch.io and you can play it online, or use the download link on the game page.</p> <p>The game is produced by Unity and C#. I implemented the enemy AI system, health system, room control system, bomb and boomerang weapons; I also designed our custom feature: shadow, and made most of the animations.</p> <p>Animations are made out of open-source spritesheets found on Open Sprite Resource. Some art resources like background music in our custom levels are made by Suno AI, and some complex custom sprites are generated by diffusion models.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"#notes-on-eecs-subjects","title":"notes on EECS subjects","text":"<p>Programming and Computer Systems</p> <ul> <li>C++ Programming</li> <li>Data Structures and Algorithms</li> </ul> <p>AI and Optimization: </p> <ul> <li>Machine Learning &amp; Deep Learning</li> <li>Nonlinear Optimization</li> <li>Computer Vision</li> <li>Nature Language Processing</li> <li>Unity Game Dev</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#notes-on-math-subjects","title":"notes on Math subjects","text":"<ul> <li>Measure Theory (following Real Analysis by Folland)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"zh/","title":"Qiulin's Homepage","text":"\ud83c\udf10 Language: English \u4e2d\u6587 <p>\u8fd9\u91cc\u662f Qiulin from University of Michigan, \u4e3b\u4fee Math&amp;CS.</p> <p>\u559c\u6b22 computer vision, computer graphics, game&amp;game engine dev.</p> <p>\u4e5f\u559c\u6b22\u5206\u6790\u5b66, \u62d3\u6251\u5b66\u548c\u5fae\u5206\u51e0\u4f55.</p> <p>\u4f1a\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7f51\u7ad9\u53d1\u5e03\u4e00\u4e9b\u7b14\u8bb0, \u6c42\u4f6c\u52ff\u55b7.</p>"},{"location":"zh/#projects","title":"\u6e38\u620f projects","text":""},{"location":"zh/#zelda-1986-dungen-level-1","title":"Zelda 1986, Dungen Level 1 \u590d\u523b","text":"<p>EECS 494 \u7684 p1. web play \u94fe\u63a5\u5728\u8fd9\u91cc: Zelda 1986 Game, \u7531 itch.io host. </p>"},{"location":"zh/#cs","title":"CS \u7b14\u8bb0","text":"<p>Programming and Computer Systems</p> <ul> <li>C++ Programming</li> <li>\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u7b97\u6cd5</li> </ul> <p>AI and Optimization: </p> <ul> <li>\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60</li> <li>\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4f18\u5316</li> <li>\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9</li> <li>\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406</li> <li>Unity \u6e38\u620f\u5f00\u53d1</li> </ul>"},{"location":"zh/#_1","title":"\u6570\u5b66\u7b14\u8bb0","text":"<ul> <li>\u6d4b\u5ea6\u8bba (following Real Analysis by Folland)</li> </ul>"}]}
