I am familiar with C++ and Unreal Engine; and proficient in python, C# and Unity engine.</p> <p>I am also a Math fan out of interest. I love analysis and differential geometry. Currently I am reading Probability: Theory and Examples by Durret for measure-based probability theory, and Intro to Smooth Manifolds by John Lee for differential topology.</p> <p>I post study notes on Github.
