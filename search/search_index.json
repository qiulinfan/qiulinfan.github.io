I love analysis and differential geometry. So far I have read Real Analysis: Modern Techniques and Their Applications by Folland for measure theory and Intro to Topological Manifolds by John Lee for topology, etc. Currently I am reading Probability: Theory and Examples by Durret for measure-based probability theory, and Intro to Smooth Manifolds by John Lee for differential topology. I plan to finish them in this year and next year I will learn some Fourier analysis, stochastic differential equations and Riemannian geometry. I post notes on my personal website, the majority of which are written in Chinese.</p>"},{"location":"#game-projects","title":"Game Projects","text":""},{"location":"#eecs-494","title":"EECS 494","text":""},{"location":"#recreation-of-zelda-1986-dungen-level-1","title":"Recreation of Zelda 1986, Dungen Level 1","text":"<p>This is my replica of the OG game Zelda 1986, coauthered with James Tian: Zelda 1986 Game, as the project 1 of EECS 494. The game is hosted on itch.io and you can play it online, or use the download link on the game page.</p> <p>The game is produced by Unity and C#. I implemented the enemy AI system, health system, room control system, bomb and boomerang weapons; I also designed our custom feature: shadow, and made most of the animations.</p> <p>Animations are made out of open-source spritesheets found on Open Sprite Resource. Some art resources like background music in our custom levels are made by Suno AI, and some complex custom sprites are generated by diffusion models.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"#notes","title":"Notes","text":"<p>Notice: This personal website is under construction, so below are all empty links. </p>"},{"location":"#notes-on-eecs-subjects","title":"notes on EECS subjects","text":"<p>Programming and Computer Systems</p> <ul> <li>C++ Programming</li> <li>Data Structures and Algorithms</li> <li>Operating Systems</li> </ul> <p>AI and Optimization: </p> <ul> <li>Machine Learning &amp; Deep Learning</li> <li>Nonlinear Optimization</li> <li>Computer Vision</li> <li>Nature Language Processing</li> </ul> <p>Computer Graphics, Game Engine and Game Dev:</p> <ul> <li>Computer Graphics</li> <li>Unity &amp; Game Development</li> </ul> <p>\ud83d\udea7 Work in progress. </p>"},{"location":"#notes-on-math-subjects","title":"notes on Math subjects","text":"<ul> <li>Multivariate Mathematical Analysis (following Analysis on Manifolds)</li> <li>Matrix Theory (Numerical Linear Algebra)</li> <li>Basic Topology (following Intro to Topological Manifolds)</li> <li>Measure Theory (following Real Analysis by Folland)</li> </ul> <p>\ud83d\udea7 Work in progress. </p>"}]}
