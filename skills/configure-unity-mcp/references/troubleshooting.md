## Use the symptom ladder

Diagnose from the lowest layer upward:

1. **Project baseline** — Unity opens and compiles without MCP.
2. **Package layer** — `manifest.json` and lock file resolve the plugin.
3. **Server layer** — the configured TCP port listens.
4. **Bridge layer** — the Unity plugin registers over WebSocket.
5. **MCP layer** — list-tools/list-resources succeeds.
6. **Editor layer** — scene/resources reflect live Unity state.
7. **Control layer** — Play/Stop and Game View capture work.

Do not repair an upper layer while a lower layer is still failing.

## Codex has no Unity tools

### Symptoms

- Unity plugin is installed and connected.
- `codex mcp list` may show `unityMCP`.
- The current task exposes no Unity tools.

### Causes

- Codex started before the MCP config existed.
- The current task cached its initial tool schema.
- Config was written globally but the current client reads project config, or vice versa.
- The project is not trusted.
- The endpoint omits `/mcp`.

### Recovery

1. Run `codex mcp list` from the Unity project root.
2. Confirm `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/mcp`.
3. Fully quit and restart Codex Desktop/CLI.
4. Reopen the trusted Unity project.
5. Start a fresh task if the existing task still lacks tools.

Do not keep reconfiguring Unity when the missing step is a Codex restart.

## Server is not listening

### Symptoms

- Connection refused.
- No process owns the configured port.
- Unity MCP window shows `No Session`.

### Causes

- The local server was never started.
- The first-launch confirmation was not accepted.
- `uv`/`uvx` is missing from Unity's environment.
- Python launch failed.
- Auto-start is disabled.

### Recovery

1. Verify `uv` and `uvx` from a fresh shell.
2. Open the MCP for Unity window.
3. Start the local HTTP server.
4. Accept the one-time background launch confirmation.
5. Inspect `Library/MCPForUnity/Logs/server-launch-<port>.log`.
6. Enable auto-start in the Advanced tab.
7. Restart Unity and verify auto-start rather than trusting the toggle alone.

On GUI-launched macOS applications, shell profile changes may not reach Unity. Restart Unity/Hub after installing `uv`.

## Port listens but Unity is absent

### Symptoms

- Python/FastMCP listens.
- MCP handshake may work.
- Logs lack `Plugin registered`.
- Editor tools return no active Unity instance.

### Causes

- Unity is still compiling or reloading.
- The package failed to compile.
- WebSocket bridge did not reconnect after domain reload.
- Server belongs to a different Unity project.

### Recovery

1. Inspect the Unity Console and Editor log for C# errors.
2. Wait until `isCompiling` and asset updating are false.
3. Confirm the launch log's project/session identity.
4. Restart the server through the Unity plugin.
5. If multiple sessions exist, select the intended instance explicitly.
6. Restart Unity only after saving clean project state.

## Unity registered but tools are missing

### Symptoms

- Launch log contains `Plugin registered`.
- Tool count is zero or lower than expected.
- Some tool groups are unavailable.

### Causes

- Tool-group visibility settings disabled groups.
- Registration was sampled before Unity finished sending transforms.
- Unity domain reload interrupted registration.
- Client/server versions are mismatched.

### Recovery

1. Wait for the log line indicating Unity-side tools registered.
2. Read `mcpforunity://tool-groups` and `mcpforunity://custom-tools`.
3. Inspect the plugin's Tools/Resources tabs.
4. Verify package/server release alignment.
5. Restart the Unity bridge.
6. Re-run list-tools and list-resources.

Counts vary by release and enabled groups; validate required tool names rather than pinning one universal count.

## Unity does not compile

### Symptoms

- Play Mode is rejected.
- New MCP component types cannot load.
- Console contains `error CS...`.
- Package Manager resolution completes but domain reload fails.

### Causes

- The project was created on an older Unity/package combination.
- Several first-party packages use APIs removed by a newer Unity Editor.
- Package updates occurred while stale compile response files remained.
- A pre-release package has incompatible dependencies.

### Recovery

1. Save the original compiler errors.
2. Determine whether each error originates in project `Assets/` or `Library/PackageCache/`.
3. For PackageCache errors, look up the package's officially compatible release for the exact Unity stream.
4. Update the smallest coherent package set in `Packages/manifest.json`.
5. Let Unity update `packages-lock.json`.
6. Wait for domain reload and check again.
7. If errors reference removed PackageCache hashes or nonexistent files, use the cache recovery sequence below.

Do not edit code inside `Library/PackageCache`; it is generated and will be replaced.

## Stale Bee and PackageCache references

### Symptoms

- `CS2001: Source file ... could not be found`.
- The missing path contains an old package hash.
- The package exists under a different current hash.
- Unity continues compiling a removed package version.

### Cause

Bee compilation response files or the SourceAssetDB retained stale paths after live package replacement.

### Recovery sequence

1. Close Unity.
2. Confirm no Unity import/compiler process still owns the project.
3. Move `Library/Bee` to a dated temporary backup.
4. Reopen Unity and wait for compilation.
5. If stale response files persist, close Unity again.
6. Move the entire `Library` to a dated temporary backup.
7. Reopen Unity and allow a full import.
8. Inspect the new response files and compiler log.

Preserve the backups until the project opens and validates. Never move or delete `Assets`, `Packages`, or `ProjectSettings`.

## Visual Scripting partial-import failure

### Symptoms

- A Visual Scripting type such as `VisualScriptingHelpURLAttribute` is missing.
- The source file exists in the current PackageCache.
- The relevant `.rsp` file does not list it.

### Cause

The package content is correct, but Unity's generated compilation graph omitted a source file after incremental package updates.

### Recovery

1. Verify the missing source file exists in the official package.
2. Inspect the generated `.rsp` file for that assembly.
3. If the file is absent from the response file, close Unity and perform a full `Library` rebuild.
4. Confirm the new response file includes the source.
5. Confirm the latest Editor log contains no C# compiler errors.

Changing package versions repeatedly will not fix a stale compilation graph.

## Play Mode and Game View issues

### Play reports success but editor state remains changing

Some versions expose `is_changing=true` longer than expected even after `is_playing=true`. Confirm with at least two signals:

- the Play command succeeded;
- `is_playing=true`;
- Game View capture succeeds;
- runtime-only Inspector change can be read back.

Do not wait forever for one advisory flag. Use bounded polling and always Stop in a `finally` path.

### Screenshot request succeeds but file is absent

Game View capture can be asynchronous.

1. Read `data.fullPath`.
2. Poll for a non-empty file with a bounded timeout.
3. Keep output inside the project, preferably `Temp/MCPValidation`.
4. Verify the image format and dimensions.

### Screenshot contains only sky/ground

That may be correct for an empty scene. Prove the capture path, then judge scene content separately.

### Memoryless depth messages

URP/Game View capture may log messages such as:

- `Ignoring depth surface load action as it is memoryless`
- `Ignoring depth surface store action as it is memoryless`

If capture succeeds and no compiler/runtime exception follows, report these as render-path noise rather than an MCP connection failure. Investigate further when the image is corrupt or the target platform shows rendering defects.

## Inspector mutation safety

An Undo can restore a component value while leaving the scene marked dirty. Therefore:

- use read-only Inspector resources for the first smoke test;
- expect both generic and specialized mutation tools to reject writes during Play Mode in some releases;
- for a full automated test, require a clean saved scene, mutate in Edit Mode, read the value back, restore it, and reopen the same scene from disk through a tightly scoped `execute_code` call;
- reacquire instance IDs after the reload and confirm the serialized value returned;
- confirm `isDirty=false`;
- avoid saving solely to clear a test-induced dirty flag, because saving may serialize Unity version migrations.

If reopening the active scene is unacceptable, use a disposable saved test scene and restore the user's active scene afterward.

## Multiple Unity instances

### Symptoms

- Commands affect the wrong project.
- The server reports more than one instance.
- Calls fail because no active instance is selected.

### Recovery

1. Read `mcpforunity://instances`.
2. Copy the exact opaque `Name@hash` identifier.
3. Call `set_active_instance`.
4. Re-read active project and scene before mutation.

Never derive or reformat instance identifiers.

## Console noise classification

Classify before fixing:

- **Compiler errors** — `error CS...`; block all mutation requiring compiled code.
- **MCP launch/bridge errors** — block connection and registration.
- **Unity runtime exceptions** — evaluate against the tested scene.
- **Render capture notices** — may be non-blocking if output is valid.
- **Service entitlement errors** — for example Unity AI `NoSubscription`; unrelated to MCP unless that service is part of the task.
- **Historical Console entries** — clear Console immediately before a controlled test.

Report unrelated errors instead of removing unrelated packages without authorization.

## Known-good incident baseline

This skill was derived from a successful setup on 2026-07-31:

- macOS;
- Unity `6000.5.6f1`;
- MCP for Unity `v10.1.0`;
- local HTTP endpoint `http://127.0.0.1:8080/mcp`;
- FastMCP `3.4.5`;
- full handshake with 48 MCP tools and 19 resources;
- 35 Unity-side tools registered for that configuration.

The project initially contained packages too old for Unity 6.5. A coherent update included AI Navigation, Collaborate/Version Control, Input System, Timeline, and Visual Scripting. Incremental updates left stale Bee and Visual Scripting response files; moving `Library/Bee` was insufficient, while a recoverable full `Library` rebuild succeeded.

Treat these values as historical evidence, not current universal recommendations.
