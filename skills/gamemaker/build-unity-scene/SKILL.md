description: Read a Unity project's architecture and level requirements, then create or modify a Unity scene that respects the documented code boundaries, content structure, asset licenses, and validation workflow. Use when a programming agent needs to lay out a level, wire scene objects and components, create reusable prefabs, bind existing gameplay scripts, add camera and lighting, configure build scenes, or turn a documented prototype into a technically valid Unity scene. This skill builds and validates scenes but leaves exploratory gameplay evaluation to play-unity-game.

# Build Unity Scene

Translate architecture and level requirements into a saved, inspectable Unity scene. Keep temporary prototype shortcuts visibly separate from production architecture.

## Read Before Building

1. Locate the Unity project by finding `Assets/`, `Packages/`, and `ProjectSettings/`.
2. Read repository instructions and inspect the worktree.
3. Read the architecture index, normally `Docs/GameFramework/README.md`.
4. Read the technical architecture, data/authoring rules, and the assigned level or prototype specification in full.
5. Read the relevant design source when the scene's gameplay or narrative intent is unclear.
6. Inspect existing scenes, prefabs, materials, input assets, build settings, and third-party notices.

Do not redesign the mechanic while laying out the scene. Report a design gap to the design agent.

## Inspect Unity

1. Check `mcpforunity://custom-tools`.
2. Read available Unity instances and select the intended instance if needed.
3. Read the exact editor-state resource exposed by the server.
4. Confirm that Unity is ready for tools.
5. Inspect the active scene, Console, project version, render pipeline, tags/layers, and relevant assets.
6. Search actual project shaders before assigning materials.
7. Reflect unfamiliar Unity or package APIs before writing C#.

## Plan the Scene

Define:

- target scene path and whether it is new or existing;
- scene roots and hierarchy;
- player spawn and camera;
- main light and environment lighting;
- gameplay entities, stable IDs, triggers, colliders, and anchors;
- presentation-only set dressing;
- reusable objects that should become prefabs;
- required scripts and data assets;
- required build-settings changes;
- validation criteria.

Keep gameplay truth in the documented state or component layer. Do not make animation transforms the only record of gameplay state.

## Build in Safe Order

1. Create or load the target scene.
2. Add a Camera and main Directional Light to a new scene.
3. Establish named hierarchy roots such as `Architecture`, `Gameplay`, `Set Dressing`, `Lighting`, and `UI`.
4. Block out traversal, scale, collision, spawn, and sight lines with simple geometry.
5. Add gameplay objects and semantic anchors.
6. Reuse existing licensed assets. If art is missing, use clear placeholders and hand the requirement to `search-game-art`; do not start an unrelated web search.
7. Create prefabs for objects intended for reuse.
8. Add presentation assets, materials, lighting, and atmosphere after the interaction space works structurally.
9. Save the scene and update build settings only when required by the task or framework.

Preserve unrelated scene and worktree changes. Do not overwrite an existing scene without first resolving its exact target and purpose.

## Script Workflow

When scripts are required:

1. place prototype code under an explicitly named prototype namespace and directory;
2. place production code in the architecture-defined assembly and layer;
3. edit files with the repository's required patch workflow;
4. validate scripts;
5. refresh Unity and wait for compilation;
6. read the Console before adding new script types to GameObjects;
7. add and configure components only after successful compilation;
8. read the Console again after scene wiring.

Avoid broad singletons, hidden `FindObjectOfType` dependencies, scene-name hardcoding, and static events that survive scene changes unless the architecture explicitly permits them.

## Validate Without Playtesting

Perform the programming-agent checks:

- scene saves successfully;
- no missing scripts or broken prefabs;
- required Camera and light exist;
- component references are assigned;
- colliders and triggers use intended layers;
- key objects are reachable by hierarchy and stable identifier;
- build settings are correct when in scope;
- Unity compilation has no project errors;
- scene validation reports no unresolved issues.

Do not perform exploratory gameplay or claim the scene is fun, readable, or complete. If the user also requests actual play, hand the saved artifact to `play-unity-game` as a separate pass.

## Handoff

Report:

- scene and prefab paths;
- hierarchy and gameplay objects created;
- scripts or data assets added;
- placeholders and external-asset dependencies;
- build-settings changes;
- compile, Console, and scene-validation results;
- known technical limitations;
- exact playtest target, controls, expected state sequence, and acceptance criteria for the playtest agent.
