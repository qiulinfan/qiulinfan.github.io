# Auto TA receipt

Write valid UTF-8 JSON. Paths should be absolute in an execution receipt and may be normalized only when the surrounding project requires portability.

Allowed top-level `status` values are `validated`, `prototype`, `blocked`, and `failed`. Allowed gate `verdict` values are `pass`, `fail`, and `not_tested`.

The top-level status is `validated` only when every gate with `required: true` is `pass`, all output files exist and match their hashes, and `round_trip.verdict` is `pass` with matching evidence SHA-256. A required or round-trip `fail` makes the result `failed`. A `not_tested` required gate or round trip makes the result `prototype` or `blocked` and must state a reason.

A tested round trip must have exactly one hash-verified `outputs` entry with role `editable_source` and exactly one with role `engine_delivery` or `*_engine_delivery`. The former must match the source audit's `.blend` path/hash; the latter must match the comparison delivery and clean-import input. A tested `artifact.*` gate must include an `evidence.artifacts` list whose path, SHA-256, and role match the corresponding receipt outputs.

Run `scripts/validate_receipt.py` before handoff. It parses the hashed contract and comparator JSON; validates enums, timezone-aware timestamps, absolute artifact paths, output hashes and roles, required gate evidence, minimum validated-domain coverage, source/import roles and run ids, audit schema/verdict/current implementation identity, the exact comparison check set and verdict reduction, the audited-source and delivery-to-import hash chains, and status reduction. It independently recomputes the comparison in memory from the hash-verified source audit, imported audit, and delivery with the current trusted comparator. Its own `validation_verdict: pass` means the receipt is honest and internally evidenced; it does not mean a receipt whose top-level status is `failed`, `prototype`, or `blocked` became a validated asset.
